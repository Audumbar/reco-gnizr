The interface between client and the server for updating the bookmark rating

= Details =




When the user rates the bookmark high or low, the client sends the following GET request
to the server so that it can update the bookmark's rating.

{{{
reco-gnizr-change-rating.html?bookmark_id=ID_HERE&category=TECHNOLOGY&change=+1
reco-gnizr-change-rating.html?bookmark_id=ID_HERE&category=TECHNOLOGY&change=-1
}}}


When change = +1, the bookmarks rating should go up.
When it is -1 it goes down.

Bookmark id is same as the one used in [http://code.google.com/p/reco-gnizr/wiki/BookmarkFormat BookmarkFormat]
