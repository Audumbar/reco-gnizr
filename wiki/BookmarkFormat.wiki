#labels Phase-Design
The format for sending JSON data containing bookmarks to the client:

The client widget first sends a request to reco-gnizr-get-bookmarks.html.
reco-gnizr-get-bookmarks.html may take one of the two parameters
  # url = url of the page on which widget is embedded. The server then has to fetch the actual url, parse the content and then recommend the bookmarks.
  # content = content of the page on which widget is embedded. This involves a lot of traffic and thus not recommended. (Need to decide which format to use.)

  *  id is the identifier of the bookmark in the database
  *  link is the actual url
  *  It is recommended that the bookmarks be sorted in the descending order of their rating. 
  *  Stick to the format given below, no extra commas or brackets else json will be broken
