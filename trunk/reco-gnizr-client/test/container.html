                    Unless the search functionality on this blog is broken, somehow nobody has talked
                    about lifestreams. Many people have a personal blog, maybe a professional one, as
                    well as Flickr, Del.icio.us and other sites that we update on a daily basis. While
                    there isn't currently a leader in the lifestream business, the concept is rather
                    clear. By taking all of your daily online activities, and putting them into one
                    place, a lifestream is created. You may think that your blog is already doing that,
                    but it doesn't include the data from all your other outlets that you use throughout
                    the day. By putting all this information together in one place, you or your viewers
                    can get a more thorough view of both who you are and what you do.<br />

                    Late last month Microsoft introduced their<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/interop/">
                        interoperability initiative</a>, launching a campaign whose mission it is to
                    convince people that Microsoft is committed to openness and standards compliance.
                    This announcement came 5 days before the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080226-heavy-fine-looms-in-ongoing-microsofteu-tussle.html">
                        EU fined Microsoft</a> a record $1.36 billion in an anti-trust lawsuit that
                    has been ongoing for many years.<br />
                    <br />
                    Microsoft seems to be playing catchup, opening up development and designer tools
                    to students for free, giving away free copies of top software in their <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/events/hhhlaunch/default.mspx">

                    <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/index.html">Lucene</a> is a very popular
                    open source IR index creation package. I was about to post a simple example showing
                    what classes and general architecture you would need to create a spider to crawl
                    the web using Lucene, but then it hit me <a href="http://www.manageability.org/blog/stuff/open-source-web-crawlers-java">
                        there are already dozens of open source web crawlers</a> written on top of <a href="http://www.manageability.org/blog/stuff/full-text-lucene-jxta-search-engine-java-xml">
                            dozens of open source information retrieval engines</a>.<br />
                    <br />
                    Sure I could throw out some example code, but why bother implementing your own when
                    there are so many packages out there that can do it for you. Even if they don't
                    do exactly what you want it would still be easier to just modify the source of an
                    existing project than to create your own from a Lucene foundation. Tragically, I
                    didn't realize this before I made my own for <a href="http://morpheus.cs.umbc.edu:8080/PolVox/">
                        PolVox</a>. Still, if anyone wants a tutorial/example just leave me a comment
                    about it and I might throw one out there...</p>

            <div class="post-body entry-content">
                <p>
                    One of the big problems with web applications is that you do have to be connected
                    to the web to update and access your data. &nbsp;A company named Joyent is trying
                    to remedy this situation with a product called <a href="http://www.joyent.com/developers/slingshot/">
                        Slingshot</a>. &nbsp;The idea with Slingshot is simple: Write one set of code
                    for your web app and desktop app, and provide a means for the desktop app to edit
                    and add data when you're not connected to the web, and sync it up when you grab
                    an internet connection again.</p>
                <div>
                    The really neat thing about Slingshot is that you are writing one set of code, and
                    you're getting your web application, mac app, and windows app in one felled swoop.
                    &nbsp;You also get the ability to add desktop-app features to the application, like
                    drag-and-drop file control. &nbsp;You also get much of the functionality right out
                    of the box - there isnt much you have to do to package an application like this.
                    &nbsp;Finally, it's sitting on top of the Ruby on Rails web framework, which, from
                    personal experience, is just about the easiest to work with and most feature-rich
                    web framework I've encountered. &nbsp;</div>
                <div>
                    The only question I have is that while an extension like this is certainly valuable
                    now, it comes on the heels of very rapid development of internet connection infrastructure.
                    &nbsp;So while the development is interesting, I think more valuable will probably
                    be the day when searching for an internet connection isn't exactly an adventure
                    in itself. &nbsp;</div>

                    Trust and Ethics in the Web 2.0 World</a>
            </h3>

                <p>
                    In the web-driven world of today, we're entrusting more and more of our private
                    data to individuals and corporations, and expecting that some sort of "See no evil,
                    hear no evil, do no evil" law is in effect. &nbsp;And this is all well and good...well,
                    until this rule is broken.</p>
                <div>
                    G-Archiver is an application designed to aid in archiving your web data to your
                    disk. &nbsp;And well, they seem to have <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001072.html">
                        broken the golden rule</a>. &nbsp;When you trust the developer of the app to
                    not cache your information and phone home with it, well, thats not exactly the case.
                    &nbsp;The developer has seemingly set up a gmail account, and when you log your
                    username and password into the application, it shoots off an email with your login
                    and password. &nbsp;</div>
                <div>
                    The story is interesting merely due to the developer getting caught - the application
                    is closed source, and the fact that they were able to peak in to see the offending
                    code really is brilliant. &nbsp;But the bigger discussion to be had is what makes
                    this situation unrealistic? &nbsp;Luckily this time it was a small time developer,
                    but what happens if some rogue google employee were to do the same? &nbsp;What if
                    a big company decided to do something similar? &nbsp;Its unrealistic at this point
                    that we just stop storing information online. &nbsp;But maybe its time to have a
                    serious discussion of accountability and ethics and establish a baseline policy
                    for everyone to follow - that includes, at the top, a means to ensure accountability
                    for the consumer.</div>
